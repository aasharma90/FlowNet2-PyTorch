This is a slightly modified version of the original flownet2-pytorch code available from here https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch
The modifications are only carried out to make it compatible to python 3.6.3. 

To run a sample test, download the checkpoints (pre-trained models from the URL mentioned above) and place them in the ./checkpoints/ directory; similarly add the datasets into the ./datasets/directory
Please go through the README.txt file to setup some environment variables and look for a few sample run commands.
